        <p><strong>The User journey to buy cryptocurrencies from the Company will consist of the following steps:</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>A User/prospective User visit the Company’s transaction Desk through either a Website or a Mobile application of a third-party platform (the “P2P Platforms”) on which the Company advertises its services.</li>
            <li>A prospective User, in line with its request, will be directed to the P2P trading section on the P2P platform. The P2P Platform could be for example, Binance, OKX, Huobi, Paxful and Bybit, or others.</li>
            <li>When creating an account at the P2P Platform’s P2P page, the prospective User agrees to the Terms of Business of the P2P Platform on which they have registered on.</li>
            <li>The customer will then go to the p2p trading section to buy/sell cryptocurrencies, where they will see one of the Company’s advertisements, along with the rate on the advertisement and the Company’s terms of trade.</li>
            <li>Once the User is ready to purchase, they start the purchasing process by initiating an order request for the Fiat Money (CZK, SEK, NOK, HUF, or others) or the Digital Asset (USDT, USDC) on the amount they are interested to buy. Afterwards, the Company enters into a live chat with the customer, where Users are guided to verify their identity. The Company will then perform the customer identification and verification assessments on the prospective User, applying the risk-based approach set out in its Anti Money Laundering & Know Your Customer Policy.</li>
            <li>Once the User is successfully verifying their identity, they will then be able to complete the current order request.</li>
            <li>The User will be prompted to make payment for the order through EU registered bank account as per the rate displayed on the advertisement.</li>
            <li>Once the payment has arrived into the Company’s bank account, the Company will release the Digital Assets to the User via the escrow of the P2P Platforms, the User would then be able to see the purchased assets in their crypto wallet on the P2P Platform.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>A typical User journey to sell cryptocurrency differs slightly. After being verified, the User places an order on the P2P Platform. The rate is advertised and displayed before they place the order. After placing the order, the cryptocurrencies automatically move into the escrow of the P2P Platforms for custody. The Company is then able to authorise to pay the transacted value to the User.</p>
        <p>6.3. The Company will extend its efforts to settle transactions in a reasonable time. Where the Company is aware of any delays in settlement, it will communicate with you where possible before it executes an order.</p>
        <p>6.4. The Company may accept or reject to offer its Services at its discretion. An order shall not be accepted by the Company, and no binding obligation to supply any Services shall arise, until the earlier of:</p>

You hereby authorise us to charge or deduct the Fee applicable and owed to us automatically. You shall be responsible for any fees charged by your bank or the p2p platform relating to the purchase of Digital Assets.</p>
        <p>6.7. Any order placed will be executed once the payment due by the User has been made to the Company’s bank accounts. In the event the payment received is lower and/or higher than the amount required to execute the order, the Company may in its sole discretion:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>6.7.1. automatically update and execute the order in accordance with the amount paid/received, and notify you of the updated order; or</li>
            <li>6.7.2. contact you to receive new instructions; or</li>

        </ul>
